# Mood-Anxiety (MAX)

In the MAX experiment participants were presented with two conditions: threat and safe. Each condition was presented as a block of length 16.25 seoncds. Thirty-six regions of interest (ROI) were selected to look at the temporal evolution of the responses during both conditions. ROI analysis on the 36 selected ROIs was performed on each subject's fMRI data. Evolution of the response during presentation of the two conditions was estimated by specifying an estimation window from the onset of the block until 20 seconds after. Estimation window is kept a little longer (20s) than the block length (which is 16.25s) to observe decay in the response.
